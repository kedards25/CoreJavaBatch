Types of errors
	Syntax=>Compile Time errors
		e.g.	missing ,; or mismatching {},()
		These errors can be handled at the time of compiling 			the code
	Logical errors
		e.g.	want to perform addition and using *
		code will compile and execute successfully but will 		not give any desired output
	Runtime errors
		e.g.Withdrawal of money using ATM
		Errors those may or may not occur at the time of 		execution so in order to handle these errors we have 		to write code in such a way that if there is any error 		then that should be handled gracefully so that the 		code does not end abruptly

Throwable is the base class to handle all the exceptions in Java which gets inherited by Exception and Error class
Exception class
	contains error which we should handle

Error class
	Contains errors which occur due to java runtime environment

Types of Exception
	Checked exception
		The exceptions which compiler is aware of and would 		suggest the developer to write the code to handle the 		error that may occur

	Unchecked exception
		The exceptions which compiler is unaware of and would 		not suggest the developer to write the code to handle 		the error that may occur

To implement exception handling we need to enclose the code in either try..catch block or should be decorated with throw or throws keyword

Try..catch block can be used to handle exceptions that may occur while
connecting to external resources such as Database or file so despite of the error we should close the resource
so we should put that code in finally block
finally block executes irrespective of exception
