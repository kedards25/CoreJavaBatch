Loops help us to run specific block of codes for given number of times

To execute loop we require an iterator
Iterator helps us to repeat the code
in order to achieve this iterator has to be provided with
	1.initial value
	2.condition
	3.incr/decr

while loop
while the condition is true keep executing the block
int i=0;	//initial value
while(i<10)	//condition
{
	s.o.p("Hello");
	i++;	//incr/decr
}


do..while
it executes the code atleast once irrespective of the condition

int i=0;
do
{
	//code here
	i++;
}while(i<10);

for loop
makes the code compact by arranging all the factors of loop in one line

for(int i=0;i<10;i++)
{
	//code here
}
