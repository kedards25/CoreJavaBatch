Limitations of inheritance
	Parent cannot access properties of child class
	Child cannot access private members off parent

To overcome these limitations, we have concept of inner classes
We can declare child class within definition of parent class

	Inner classes
	Static nested classes
	Method local inner classes
	Anonymous classes
		One of the class will be unknown
		Unknown means class is used from pre-defined package
