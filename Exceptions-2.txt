next concept is rethrow

rethrow is used to throw an exception again from catch block

In real world situations,if we throw these kind of errors involving technical terms,common people will not understand these keywords
for e.g.
	If an ATM machine do not have connection with the server then instead of showing that technical error we get a simple message stating "Out of Service" which can be easily understood by everyone

in above case we can create our own exception which will show a valid error message to be understood by everyone

In order to create our own exception we need to create our own exception class and make it inherit the base class i.e. Exception class
lets start with the code
