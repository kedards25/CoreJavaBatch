Any transaction should possess following properties

Atomicity
	Transaction would either complete or rolled back

Consistency
	Data that we receive is in consistent format	

Isolation
	When two or more transactions try to access same data 	concurrently,the transactions execute independent of each other

Durability
	Making sure that data is available even in case of system 	failure

Implicit
	Default Mode of SQL
	Auto-commits all the transactions

Explicit
	Can be implemented by setting autocommit(false)
	and then committing the transaction explicity,we can roll back 	transaction in case of failure/exception
